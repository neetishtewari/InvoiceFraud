# InvoiceFraud
detecting possible invoice fraud the invoice data. 

This has an interesting premise but getting the correct data is difficult. 

actual data is likely to be very lopsided and has to be collected from different companies. 

I scrapped it after starting on realizing that the dat being used ws deliberately tampered to resemble fraudulent invoice data.
